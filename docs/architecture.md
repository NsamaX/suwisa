# Adding features

The Discord layer is an adapter. Keep business rules in ordinary Python modules so they can be tested without Discord or a token.

## Dependency direction

`Discord cog -> feature service -> feature models / parser`

The OCR engine implements `OcrEngine`. Storage depends on receipt models. `bot.py` constructs these adapters and injects them; the parser never imports Discord, SQLite, or Tesseract.

## Add a feature

1. Create `src/suwisa/features/<feature>/` with `__init__.py`, `cog.py`, and its models/service modules.
2. Give `cog.py` an `async def setup(bot)` entry point that calls `bot.add_cog(...)`.
3. Add its module name to `FEATURE_EXTENSIONS` in `bot.py`.
4. Add storage migrations if needed. SQLite `PRAGMA user_version` currently equals 1; upgrade existing databases transactionally. Do not drop tables to migrate.
5. Test business rules and authorization before enabling the feature.

For income/expense recording, introduce a separate ledger model. A reviewed receipt is evidence, not automatically an expense. A wallet top-up may be an internal transfer. Store money with exact decimals or integer minor units, never floats. Receipt payloads currently use decimal strings.

## OCR and parsing

- Implement `OcrEngine.read(bytes) -> OcrDocument` and select it in `bot.py` / CLI. Cloud OCR should be an explicit configured provider because it sends receipts outside the machine.
- Add a parser module for each new bank layout; reuse amount/date helpers.
- Prefer missing values and review warnings over guesses. Never infer dates from reference numbers or use the largest number as a total.
- Recipient normalization is limited to recognized identifiers such as `TMNTOPUP`; it does not authenticate a transaction.

## Lifecycle

Allowlist -> attachment limit -> bounded OCR slot -> decode/EXIF normalization -> Thai/English OCR -> parser -> review -> optional save.

One OCR job runs at a time, with at most three users admitted and one job per user. OCR uses a worker thread; each Tesseract subprocess has a timeout (up to three passes per image). Discord heartbeats continue during OCR.

Review state lives in memory for 10 minutes. Database writes happen only on confirmation, with a unique image hash and optional reference scoped to guild + owner. Cancelled, expired or interrupted reviews are not stored. SQL uniqueness protects concurrent writes.

`/receipt` replies ephemerally. Automatic attachment replies appear in the configured channel; use a private bookkeeping channel if needed. Both enforce the same user/guild/channel allowlists. Buttons enforce ownership.

## Boundaries

- No general chat reasoning, ledger, exports, reminders, line-item extraction or bank verification API yet.
- No persistent image archive; design retention and backup together before adding one.
- Health reflects recent Discord readiness/latency, not OCR accuracy. Unhealthy status alone does not restart a Docker container.
- Schema changes can make old images unsuitable for rollback. Back up first and restore a compatible database when necessary.
